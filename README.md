# Dataset overview
    Columns
    1) CustomerID: Unique id for each cistomer
    2) Gender: Male & Female
    3) Age: Age of the customer.
    4) Annual Income: Annual income of customer(unit=(k$))
    5) Spending Score (1-100)- It is a numerical value assigned to customers based on their purchasing behavior. The score typically ranges from 1 to 100, where a higher score indicates a higher likelihood of the customer spending more.
    The Spending Score is often derived from various factors such as:
    Frequency of purchases: How often does the customer make a purchase?
    Monetary value of purchases: How much money does the customer spend per transaction?
    Types of products purchased: Are the purchases high-margin items or lower-margin items?
    Recency of purchases: How recently did the customer make a purchase?
    A customer with a high Spending Score is likely to be more valuable to a business as they contribute more to revenue. On the other hand, a lower Spending Score might indicate a customer who makes infrequent or smaller purchases.
